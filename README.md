<h2>Open Source products, Digital Public Goods (international), Digital/Internet commons (EU)</h2>

Welcome to the Open Content Project page - [OpenCode.md](https://opencode.md/en).

The OpenCode.md project is a [Registry](https://opencode.md/en/registry/) of [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) products that meet the requirements of ["Digital Public Goods"](https://opencode.md/en/about/digital-public-goods/).

A Digital Public Good is defined as: [Open Source Software](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-source-software/), [Open Data](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-data/), Open AI models, [Open Standards](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-standards/) and [Open Content](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-content/) that meet all [requirements for Open Source Solutions](https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements/), help achieve the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://opencode.md/en/about/sustainable-development-goals/), were developed based on the [Digital Development Principles](https://opencode.md/en/about/principles-digital-development/), adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, are published in one of the [approved Git repositories](https://opencode.md/en/about/git-repositories/), and use [approved Open License](https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses/) and are in working conditions.

[Digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation) is the integration of digital technologies by companies and the impact of the technologies on society.
Technologies could help to optimise production, reduce emissions and waste, boost companiesâ€™ competitive advantages and bring new services and products to consumers.

We present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the community of Republic of Moldova and our neighboring countries.

The aim of the project is to innovate through Open Source software (Open Code), Open Content, Open Standards and Open Data for transparency and civic tech. At OpenCode.md, we would present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the community of Republic of Moldova and our neighboring countries.

Open Source Solutions can be a good force for a country's digital transformation efforts, including: Open Source Software helps government agencies better serve their citizens, Open Data and Open Content help digital solutions make better decisions, and Open Standards improve digital interoperability.

If you are curious to know about how the Opencode.md functions, visit [our website](https://opencode.md/en).

<h3>We support 2 kinds of Open Source Solutions:</h3>
<h4>1) Trustful International Open Source Solutions </h4>

- trusted developers that have extended community, 
- provided regular updates of its Solutions during the last 1 year.

<h4>2)  Solutions submitted be developers to opencode.md and passed verification procedure,</h4>
it is provided, that this resource will bring together all open software solutions that:

- submitted an application to be included in the list of approved open source solutions of the project OpenCode.md and passed it;
- support the workability of your solution in the future; annual checks of the open source solution for compliance with tried and tested solutions are provided.

This resource is intended to bring together all open source software solutions that meet the tried and tested solution requirements outlined above.

<hr>

The OpenCode.md project is a Registry of Open Source products that meet the requirements of â€œDigital Public Goodsâ€œ (International), and
Digital/Internet commons (EU), published on Approved Git Repositories and use open licenses.

A Digital Public Goods (DPG) is defined as:
- open source software,
- open data,
- open AI models,
- open standards and
- open content

More details about DPG,

Requirements for Open Source Solutions, more details
https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements/

Approved Open Licenses, more details
https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses/

The list of Approved Git Repositories is presented here
https://opencode.md/en/about/git-repositories/

The Digital/internet commons (EU) includes open source software, open hardware, open design, open licensing, open standards and open data.
for more details, https://opencode.md/en/about/digital-internet-commons-eu/

The Registry of Digital Public goods is divided into 21 topics and presented here:
https://opencode.md/en/registry/

We keep 2 kinds of the list of solutions: 
List 1) International 
This is trustful International solutions that we included ourselves into the Registry 
and that corresponds to the following requirements 
- are in working conditions 
- have state (status) Active
- show one of the license from the list of Approved Open Licenses (see above)
- have extensive community of Open source Developers that support this solution 
- updated regularly, at least 1 time per year 

List 2) Submitted application to be included into the the Registry of OpenCode.md 
this is solutions that corresponds the Requirements for Open Source Solutions (see above)

Mentioned solutions from both lists are periodically indexed by the Opencode.md crawler application that corresponds to Requirements indicated above. 

The audience of our service is the companies and physical persons that are interested in using trustful and secured Open Source solutions that are in working conditions and updated regularly and secured and that don't bring harm.
The examples of such users:
- Developers of Open Source Solutions
- Innovators
- Companies that implement Open source Solution

You can create and support own structured Registry of Open Source products (solutions) (or its descriptions)
- for public organizations as the Register of government products
- for country, municipal or regional entities as Register of products of local government
- for niche solutions (Linux DevOps, Open AI models, agriculture, medical etc.) 
- for educational institutions as Register of own Open Source solutions
- for NGO and Non-profit organizations as own Resister of solutions, important documents et.
- for event, conference or hackathon organizers to keep the structured result of their activity
