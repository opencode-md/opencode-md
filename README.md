<h2>Open Source products, Digital Public Goods (international), Digital/Internet commons (EU)</h2>

Welcome to the Open Content Project page - [OpenCode.md](https://opencode.md/en).

The OpenCode.md project is a [Registry](https://opencode.md/en/registry/) of [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) products that meet the requirements of ["Digital Public Goods"](https://opencode.md/en/about/digital-public-goods/).

The Digital Public Goods includes: [Open Source Software](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-source-software/), [Open Data](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-data/), [Open AI models](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-ai-models/), [Open Standards](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-standards/) and [Open Content](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-content/) that meet all [requirements for Open Source Solutions](https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements/), help achieve the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://opencode.md/en/about/sustainable-development-goals/), were developed based on the [Digital Development Principles](https://opencode.md/en/about/principles-digital-development/), adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, are published in one of the [approved Git repositories](https://opencode.md/en/about/git-repositories/), and use [approved Open License](https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses/) and are in working conditions.

The [Digital/internet commons (EU)](https://opencode.md/en/about/digital-internet-commons-eu/) includes open source software, [open hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware), [open design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-design_movement), open licensing, open standards and open data.

[Digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation) is the integration of digital technologies by companies and the impact of the technologies on [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society).
Technologies could help to optimise production, reduce emissions and waste, boost companies‚Äô competitive advantages and bring new services and products to consumers.

We present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the civil society and community.

The aim of the project is to innovate through Open Source software (Open Code), Open Content, Open Standards and Open Data for transparency and [Civic Tech](https://opencode.md/en/about/civic-tech/). At OpenCode.md, we would present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the Open Source community. 

<h4>Open Source Solutions can be a good force for a country's digital transformation efforts, including:</h4>

- Open Source Software
  - in [Civic Tech](https://opencode.md/en/about/civic-tech/) allows effective interaction inside [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society) and
  - in [GovTech](https://opencode.md/en/about/civictech-govtech/) helps government agencies better serve [public sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector) and their citizens,
- Open Data and Open Content help digital solutions make better decisions, and
- Open Standards improve [digital interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability).

<h3>Opencode.md support 2 kinds of Open Source Solutions:</h3>
<h4>1) Trustful International Open Source Solutions:</h4>

- trusted developers that have extended community;
- are in working conditions;
- have "Active" state (status);
- use one license from the list of [Approved Open Licenses](https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses/);
- have an extensive community of Open source Developers supporting this solution;
- updated regularly (at least 1 time per year).

<h4>2) Solutions submitted be developers to opencode.md and passed verification procedure,</h4>
it is provided, that this resource will bring together all open software solutions that:

- submitted an application to be included in the list of approved open source solutions of the project OpenCode.md and passed it;
- support the workability of your solution in the future;
- annual checks of the open source solution for compliance with tried and tested solutions are provided.

This solutions corresponds the [Requirements for Open Source Solutions](https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements/), 
This resource is intended to bring together all open source software solutions that meet the tried and tested solution requirements outlined above.
The solutions from both lists are periodically indexed by the Opencode.md crawler.

<hr>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>

The audience of our service is the companies and physical persons that are interested in using trustful and secured Open Source solutions that are in working conditions and updated regularly and secured and that don't bring harm.

<h4>The examples of customers/users:</h4>

- Developers of Open Source Solutions
- Innovators
- Companies that implement Open source Solution

<h4>own structured Registry of Open Source products (solutions)</h4>
You can create and support own structured Registry of Open Source products (solutions) or its descriptions:

- for public organizations as the Register of government products
- for country, municipal or regional entities as Register of products of local government
- for niche solutions (Linux DevOps, Open AI models, agriculture, medical etc.) 
- for educational institutions as Register of own Open Source solutions
- for NGO and Non-profit organizations as own Resister of solutions, important documents et—Å.
- for event, conference or hackathon organizers to keep the structured result of their activity
<hr>
<h3>The OpenCode.md ensure 3 types priority of scanning accounts and solutions that hosting on  approved Git Repositories: </h3>
<h4>1) the Highest priority:</h4>
Scanning of the products from own Registry of OpenCode.md, including:

- International trustful solutions (selection of Opencode.md administration)
- Solutions that submitted application and it be included into the Registry 
(by initiative of owner the Open source product)

<h4>2) The Middle priority:</h4>
by API with GitHub from the internal list of the Opencode.md, including:

- accounts of the companies or developers  
- solutions of Open Source solutions of the governments
- solutions of third party Registers

<h4>3) The Low priority:</h4>
by API with GitHub, basing on the analysis of the activity of the developers in Github Repository:

- accounts of the companies or developers  
- solutions of Open source solutions
  
<hr>
<h3>Development plans for Opencode.md</h3>

- development API for exchanging information about search indexes between projects created based on the core of the open source solution;
- implementaion API for exchanging information with the Open Web Index project.

<h3>We support 2 kinds of Open Source Solutions:</h3>
<h4>1) Trustful International Open Source Solutions:</h4>

- trusted developers that have extended community, 
- provided regular updates of its Solutions during the last 1 year.

<h4>2)  Solutions submitted be developers to opencode.md and passed verification procedure,</h4>
it is provided, that this resource will bring together all open software solutions that:

- submitted an application to be included in the list of approved open source solutions of the project OpenCode.md and passed it;
- support the workability of your solution in the future;
- annual checks of the open source solution for compliance with tried and tested solutions are provided.

This resource is intended to bring together all open source software solutions that meet the tried and tested solution requirements outlined above.

<h3>We keep 2 kinds of the list of solutions:</h3>
<h4>List 1) International</h4>
This is trustful International solutions that we included ourselves into the Registry and corresponds to the following requirements: 

- are in working conditions; 
- have "Active" state (status);
- use one license from the list of [Approved Open Licenses](https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses/);
- have an extensive community of Open source Developers supporting this solution;
- updated regularly (at least 1 time per year).

<h4>List 2) Submitted application to be included into the the Registry of OpenCode.md</h4>

this solutions corresponds the [Requirements for Open Source Solutions](https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements/),
