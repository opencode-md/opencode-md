<h2>Open Source products and Digital Public Goods</h2>
Welcome to the Open Content Project page - [OpenCode.md](https://opencode.md/en). 

The OpenCode.md project is a [Registry](https://opencode.md/en/registry) of [Open Source](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-source-software) products that meet the [requirements](https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements) of ["Digital Public Goods"](https://opencode.md/en/about/digital-public-goods) in Moldova.

Such an application can be modified, supplemented to fit your needs without violating the developers’ copyrights, as well as studied for vulnerabilities, used to develop other programs, etc.

Open source usually refers to software that people can modify, share, and re-use because its design or “source code” is made publicly accessible. In order the software to be recognised as a digital public good, it must demonstrate use of an [approved open license](https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses).

Digital transformation is the integration of digital technologies by companies and the impact of the technologies on society.
Technologies could help to optimise production, reduce emissions and waste, boost companies’ competitive advantages and bring new services and products to consumers.

We present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the community of Republic of Moldova and our neighboring countries.

<h2>The Open Content project "Open Source Solutions Registry for Moldova"</h2>
Welcome to the Open Content Project page - OpenCode.md.

Open Code is ["Open Source"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) targeted as ["Digital Public Goods"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_public_goods). Such an application can be modified, supplemented to fit your needs without violating the developers' copyrights, as well as studied for vulnerabilities, used to develop other programs, etc.

The aim of the current initiative is to innovate through [Open Source software (Open Code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), [Open Content](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content), [Open Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) and [Open Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) for transparency and civic tech. At OpenCode.md, we would present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the community of Republic of Moldova and our neighboring countries.

Open Source Solutions can be a good force for a country's digital transformation efforts, including: Open Source Software helps government agencies better serve their citizens, Open Data and Open Content help digital solutions make better decisions, and Open Standards improve digital interoperability.

<h3>We maintain a Registry of Open Source Solutions that comply the following basic principles:</h3>

- complies with the ["Sustainable Development Goals"](https://sdg-tracker.org/);
- used ["Approved Open Licenses"](https://opensource.org/licenses/);
- designed and developed in accordance with the ["Principles for Digital Development"](https://digitalprinciples.org/principles/);
- published on GitHub any [acceptable Git Repository Services](https://opencodemd.wordpress.com/about/git-repository-services/);
- the solution is aimed at solving one of the  priority fields [content sections](https://opencodemd.wordpress.com/content-sections/);
- adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design and meet the ["OpenCode.md Standards Requirements"](https://opencodemd.wordpress.com/standards-requirements/);
- are in working conditions.
