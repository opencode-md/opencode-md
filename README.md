<h2>Open Source products and Digital Public Goods for Moldova</h2>

Welcome to the Open Content Project page - [OpenCode.md](https://opencode.md/en).

The OpenCode.md project is a [Registry](https://opencode.md/en/registry/) of [Open Source](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-source-software/) products that meet the [requirements](https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements/) of ["Digital Public Goods"](https://opencode.md/en/about/digital-public-goods/) in Moldova.

Such an application can be modified, supplemented to fit your needs without violating the developers‚Äô copyrights, as well as studied for vulnerabilities, used to develop other programs, etc.

Open source usually refers to software that people can modify, share, and re-use because its design or ‚Äúsource code‚Äù is made publicly accessible. In order the software to be recognised as a digital public good, it must demonstrate use of an [approved open license](https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses/).

[Digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation) is the integration of digital technologies by companies and the impact of the technologies on society.
Technologies could help to optimise production, reduce emissions and waste, boost companies‚Äô competitive advantages and bring new services and products to consumers.

We present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the community of Republic of Moldova and our neighboring countries.

The aim of the project is to innovate through [Open Source software (Open Code)](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-source-software/), [Open Content](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-content/), [Open Standards](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-standards/) and [Open Data](https://opencode.md/en/about/open-data/) for transparency and civic tech. At OpenCode.md, we would present, show and promote the technology that can enable citizens to more meaningfully engage in the public sphere and have a positive impact on the community of Republic of Moldova and our neighboring countries.

Open Source Solutions can be a good force for a country's digital transformation efforts, including: Open Source Software helps government agencies better serve their citizens, Open Data and Open Content help digital solutions make better decisions, and Open Standards improve digital interoperability.

<h3>We maintain a Registry of Open Source Solutions that comply the following basic principles:</h3>

- complies with the ["Sustainable Development Goals"](https://opencode.md/en/about/sustainable-development-goals/);
- used ["Approved Open Licenses"](https://opencode.md/en/about/approved-open-licenses/);
- designed and developed in accordance with the ["Principles for Digital Development"](https://opencode.md/en/about/principles-digital-development/);
- published on any [acceptable Git Repository Services](https://opencode.md/en/about/git-repositories/);
- belong to any theme of [Software Registry](https://opencode.md/en/registry/);
- adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design;
- meet the ["OpenCode.md Requirements"](https://opencode.md/en/about/requirements/) and;
- are in working conditions.

If you are curious to know about how the Opencode.md functions, visit [our website](https://opencode.md/en).

<h3>We support 2 lists of Open Source Solutions:</h3>
<h4>1) Trustful International Open Source Solutions </h4>

- trusted developers that have extended community, 
- provided regular updates of its Solutions during the last 1 year.

<h4>2)  Solutions submitted be developers to opencode.md and passed verification procedure,</h4>
it is provided, that this resource will bring together all open software solutions that:

- submitted an application to be included in the list of approved open source solutions of the project OpenCode.md and passed it;
- support the workability of your solution in the future; annual checks of the open source solution for compliance with tried and tested solutions are provided.

This resource is intended to bring together all open source software solutions that meet the tried and tested solution requirements outlined above.
